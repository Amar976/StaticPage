        <h5>Save On Taxes</h5>
        <p class="para">It may seem frivolous, but one great reason to get a health insurance policy is to save on
          taxes. Premiums
          that you pay to maintain a HealthCare insurance policy are exempt from taxes under Section 80D of the Income
          Tax Act. If you’ve bought a health insurance plan for yourself, your spouse or your kids, you can claim up to
          INR 25,000 per year. If you’ve bought a health insurance plan for your parents who are over the age of 60, you
          can claim an additional deduction of INR 50,000 per year. #Please note tax benefits are subject to change in
          Income Tax laws.</p>
